Notice:
 
- Do confirm the direction of the cltuch bearing before pressing it in.
- Pad a pulley under the bearing and punch it out if it was pressed in the oppsite way.

- A SH M3x48 screw should be insert into the BMG/MK8 gear as shaft
from the side of CSK8PP. (For M3x48 screw + printed shaft user. No need if using D-shaft)
- (D-shaft is recommended for a smoother rotation)

- Install washer to both ends of the spring.
- The spring should be precompressed to keep filament from slipping.

- This rewinder is designed for 5.8L dry box.

- Install TPU sleeves to the rewinding wheel if it is too slippy.
